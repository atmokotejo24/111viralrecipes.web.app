The options are endless when it comes to side dish pairings for this chicken dinner. Serve it up with some creamy orzo, roasted asparagus, or air fryer green beans. Black Pepper Dried Parsley Sugar (Optional) There is no salt in the list as I have found that works better to add the salt to the flour. The sugar is optional, I like to add it as it makes the seasoning rub taste far more like the McCormick Lemon &amp; Pepper Seasoning or Masterfoods Lemon Pepper Seasoning that you can buy at the grocery store. Use a cast iron skillet or oven-proof stainless steel pan and heat over medium heat until hot.
