recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Make sure the shrimp and chicken is thawed beforehand."

- "Step 3            In a skillet, cut up chicken into small bite-sized pieces. Season with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Don&#39;t start cooking until the water for the noodles starts boiling. Then start cooking chicken on medium heat."
- "Step 4            Put spaghetti noodles in boiling water (be sure to turn down and adjust the heat, so it still boils, but doesn&#39;t boil over. As soon as the noodles are added to the water, stir them, so they don&#39;t stick together, also stirring them occasionally. Boil for about 7-10 minutes or until done."

- "Step 8            &#34;Lightly&#34; sprinkle in some garlic, salt and pepper to the noodles, and mix in well. You don&#39;t want to over due it on the garlic in this creamy sauce, remember you could always add more later, but once it&#39;s added, you can&#39;t undo it, so best to go lightly and add seasonings if needed."
- "Step 9            Take the tails off the shrimp, cut the shrimps in half, and add to the pasta, mix in well"
- "Step 10            Make sure the chicken is done. Then add your chicken to the noodles and mix it in there too."
- "Step 11            Serve and enjoy!"
- "Step 12            Make sure you get the right jar of Alfredo sauce. I never tried this with any other Alfredo sauce, I buy &#34;Cheese creations, Ragu classic alfredo&#34; the 2pck at Walmart."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
