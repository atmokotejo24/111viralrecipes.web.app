recipeingredient:
- "8 ounces ziti or other pasta"
- "1 tablespoon butter"
- "1 lb. chicken cut into bite sized pieces"
- "1 tablespoon all purpose seasoning mix for the chicken"
- "1/4 teaspoon cayenne"
- "1 (7 ounce) jar DeLallo sun dried tomatoes drained"
- "3 cloves garlic"
- "1/2 cup half and half"
- "1 1/2 cups whole milk"
- "1/2 cup chicken broth"
- "1 1/2 cups Mozzarella cheese"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "2 cups spinach"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside."
- "Step 2            Heat the butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken and sprinkle with the seasoning and the cayenne. Saute until the chicken is cooked through."
- "Step 3            Drain the oil from the sun dried tomatoes. Chop into smaller pieces if you want. Add them to the pan with the garlic and saute for a few minutes, until fragrant. You will probably still get some of the oil from the sun dried tomatoes - that&#39;s okay."

- "Step 5            Stir in the cooked pasta and spinach - the spinach will start to cook down almost immediately. If needed, add extra water or broth or milk to the sauce to thin it out, or add more cheese to thicken slightly. Be sure to stir for a full 4-5 minutes to really thicken."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"

Pan-seared Italian seasoned chicken in a creamy sun-dried tomato spinach sauce. Cooked together with rigatoni pasta for a quick dinner made in one pot. Then the cream sauce is made by adding half-and-half, milk, chicken broth, and mozzarella cheese until it&#39;s thick and luscious and the cheese is melted and the sauce looks like something you want to eat with a spoon. Then add cooked pasta and stir until it is well-mixed, and you&#39;ll have a dreamy main course, and hopefully a ton of leftovers. The creamy sun-dried tomato sauce in this recipe is made with chopped or sliced shallot, minced garlic, flour (regular or almond flour), broth, milk (regular, unsweetened cashew milk, or unsweetened almond milk), a small amount of dijon mustard (trust me on this!), oregano, salt, pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes.
