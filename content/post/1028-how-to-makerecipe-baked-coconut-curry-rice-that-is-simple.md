I just set it everything in a baking dish, cover it with foil and let the oven do the work. When its done, the coconut cream will have settled on the top of the rice, but a quick fluff with a fork and it is well blended and perfect! Transfer the rice to a large saucepan along with the coconut milk, water, sugar and salt. We recommend using the stovetop instead of another rice cooking method like a rice cooker or the microwave.
