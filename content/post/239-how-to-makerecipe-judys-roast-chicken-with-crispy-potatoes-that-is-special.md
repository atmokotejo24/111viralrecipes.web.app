- "3-4 tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper to taste"
- "3 garlic cloves"
- "1 lemon"
- "Bunch fresh rosemary I used 23 big sprigs from the garden"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Finely slice the potatoes into rounds of about 4mm thin. You can choose to leave the potato skins on or not,"
- "Step 2            Layer the base of your cooking dish with the potatoes - overlap slight but arrange in a single layer only. Drizzle with 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper."
- "Step 3            Place the chicken on top of the potato slices. Make some incisions into the lemon, but keep whole. Place the whole lemon inside the chicken cavity’ with about 3/4 of the rosemary."
