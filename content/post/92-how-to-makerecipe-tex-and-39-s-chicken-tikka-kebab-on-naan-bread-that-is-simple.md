- "Step 9            Cover a large plate with cling film for an easy clean-up, and begin to thread your cubes of marinated chicken onto wooden skewers. Tip: cover the ends of the skewers with foil to prevent them burning during grilling or, soak them before use"
- "Step 10            Grill for 12-15 minutes on a high heat turning every 3-4 minute until you begin to see a nice char on the edges of the cubes. Put somewhere warm to rest until the naan is ready."
- "Step 11            Melt the butter in to the oil and brush liberally onto both sides of the naan. Grill the naan on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes turning once"
- "Step 12            Put the naan on a plate, and pile with your salad. Put the skewers on the salad, splash with lemon or lime juice, and serve."
- "Step 13            Eat by removing the chunks of tikka chicken from the skewers, tearing chunks off the naan, wrapping it round the chicken and salad then dipping in the mint yoghurt"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
