This one pot curry chicken noodle soup is packed with protein and immune-boosting ingredients for a wonderful lunch or dinner during colder months! Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. When it shimmers, add the garlic, ginger, and Thai red curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, until dark red and very fragrant, about. The red pepper flakes definitely add a bit of a kick, but I wouldn&#39;t say it makes Chicken Curry Soup spicy (especially when the coconut milk is added).

When it shimmers, add the garlic, ginger, and Thai red curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, until dark red and very fragrant, about. The red pepper flakes definitely add a bit of a kick, but I wouldn&#39;t say it makes Chicken Curry Soup spicy (especially when the coconut milk is added). That said, if you are at all sensitive to heat, I&#39;d recommend omitting them. If you love heat, feel free to sprinkle additional red pepper flakes on individual serving bowls.
