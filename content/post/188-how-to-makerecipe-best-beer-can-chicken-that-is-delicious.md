- " olive oil"
- " rosemary"
- " salt"
- " pepper"
- "2 cans beer"
- "20 cloves garlic"
- "1.5 lemons"
- " Hickory chips or chunks"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            When I cook I use my judgement when adding seasonings. So I apologize for the lack of measurements in advance. The entire process takes 3 days, but well worth the wait. This chicken will stay moist, even when reheated in the microwave the following day."
- "Step 2            First, remove the chicken gizzards and toss them or use them for soup later. Fill a large bowl or bucket with water. Add about 1/4 to half cup of salt to the water, along with olive oil, rosemary, Italian seasoning, pepper to taste, and some cloves of garlic (4 or 5). I prob used a total of 20 cloves throughout the entire recipe. Add the chicken to the water and cover. Let it soak for 2 days in the refrigerator. If the chicken is frozen soak for one day on the counter and a day in the refrigerator. You can soak it longer if you want. Remember, exact measurements are not necessary."
- "Step 3            Two days later... Remove the chicken from the water. Take one can of opened beer and stick it in one of the cavities. On top of the can, inside the chicken, I added 5 more cloves of garlic and half a lemon."
- "Step 4            Water bowl mixture: I used the water the chicken soaked in, in my water bowl. I added more garlic, olive oil, 1.5 lemons, another can or bottle of beer, and hickory chips or chunks."
- "Step 5            Cooking directions: Drizzle olive oil on the entire chicken. Seasonings on the skin are optional. I didn&#39;t use any additional, but it would be good either way. Cook at low heat, about 250 to 300 for at least 8 hours. Until the meat is juicy and tender. If you don&#39;t have a smoker but have a smoker box add the chips to that and place a bowl of the water mixture (see water directions above)on top of the grill to add moisture. This is very important no matter how you cook the chicken, this is part of what makes the chicken moist."
- "Step 6            Once it is cooked all the way through cut and enjoy ! It&#39;s easy to make, just takes a lot of waiting. About an hour or two before the chicken is done, trow some veggies with olive oil and garlic with preferred seasonings to the top rack."
- "Step 7            Cooking tid bits.. I cook with gain infused olive oil. Simply place about 30 (more or less to taste) and leave them soak in the oil until the oil is gone. They will change color after time but they are not spoiled. Repeat next time u purchase olive oil"
- "Step 8            Another tid bit... I cut lemons up and freeze them. I&#39;ll have slices, chunks, halves etc... then when u cook or even with drinks you will always have lemon handy"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
