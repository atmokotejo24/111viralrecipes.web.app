- "Step 2            Place the &#34;C&#34; ingredients in a 20-22cm oven-safe, shallow grill/frying pan and cook over low heat. The photo shows a 20-cm pan."
- "Step 3            Once the garlic from Step 2 has become fragrant and lightly colored, push it to the side of the pan. Add the &#34;A&#34; ingredients and season with salt and pepper."
- "Step 4            Increase the heat to low-medium. Once the bottoms of the &#34;A&#34; ingredients have cooked, turn them over and season again with salt and pepper."
- "Step 5            Pour the &#34;D&#34; white wine into Step 4 and increase the heat to medium-high."
- "Step 6            Once the wine in Step 5 has mostly evaporated, turn off the heat. Place the &#34;A&#34; ingredients into a separate bowl and set aside."
- "Step 7            [Note:] Turn off the heat when the liquid evaporates so that the garlic and &#34;A&#34; ingredients don&#39;t burn. It&#39;s okay if the &#34;A&#34; ingredients are not fully cooked at this point."
- "Step 8            Heat extra virgin olive oil in the same unwashed pan over low heat. Add the &#34;B&#34; ingredients."

- "Step 10            Cook Step 9 thoroughly for about 5 minutes so that the sweetness of the onion and celery can be completely released. It&#39;s okay if the color is lighter than shown in the photo."
- "Step 11            Add the sliced bell pepper while cooking Step 10. Once cooked, transfer to the same bowl as Step 6. I used paprika powder."
- "Step 12            Add the uncooked rice to Step 11 and cook until each grain of rice is coated with oil. Reduce the heat to medium-low."
- "Step 13            Once the rice is mixed with the oil and becomes hot, pour in the &#34;F&#34; white wine."
- "Step 14            Once the alcohol from Step 13 has cooked off, add the canned tomatoes and pour in the hot soup from Step 1 until it reaches 1 cm above the level of the ingredients"
- "Step 15            Reduce the heat to medium and set the timer to 10 minutes. If using paprika powder, add it here."
- "Step 16            Once the liquid has reduced below the level of the the ingredients, top the rice with the ingredients from the bowl in Step 6. Also add the juices from the bottom of the bowl."
- "Step 17            Add the remaining soup from Step 1. *After 5-6 minutes have passed since adding the canned tomatoes and soup in Step 14, the paella should resemble the photo shown here."
- "Step 18            As time passes, you will start to hear sizzling. After ten minutes have passed since Step 14, reduce the heat to low."
- "Step 19            Set the timer to 1 minute. After 1 minute has passed, place in the oven preheated to 200°C and bake for 16 minutes."
- "Step 20            In Step 18, the rice should resemble a risotto texture. The liquid should be at the same level or below that of the rice. There should still be some liquid left."
- "Step 21            When making this for the first time: If the bottom seems like it is going to burn, reduce the heat to low earlier than instructed. If it is too watery, increase the heat and cook it longer to cook out the liquid."
- "Step 22            The appearance and texture in Step 19 should be a little less watery than a pilaf. The rice should be cooked to al dente (the center of the grains should still be somewhat firm)."
- "Step 23            If the rice is too firm: add 50 ml of hot water and cook. Check the texture again after 2 minutes."
- "Step 24            If there is not enough liquid: Add 30 ml of hot water and turn off the heat right as it starts to boil."

- "Step 28            Squeeze some lemon over the paella and season with black pepper. Garnish with Italian parsley and it&#39;s done."
- "Step 29            I usually combine 30 ml of hot water with a tiny amount of saffron to make a saffron liquid to spray over the dish at this point. This increases the aroma and I definitely recommend it."
- "Step 30            This paella is different from the type that is just made in a frying pan. Baking it in the oven makes the rice to crispy, giving it an authentic touch."
- "Step 31            The ingredients also create a lovely finished product. The seafood is extremely delicious."
- "Step 32            Separate into 2 portions to enjoy with your special someone. If you separate it into the amount shown in the picture (a 14 cm bowl), it should be just right."
- "Step 33            After serving it up on a plate, the cross-section should look like this. It&#39;s not too runny and is somewhere between a risotto and a pilaf, with a slightly al dente cooked rice that I love."
- "Step 34            I love when there are some burned parts. They are so addictive and delicious."
- "Step 35            You can accompany it with other dishes enjoy it with drinks, it&#39;s a paella perfect for a couple. Give it a try."
- "Step 36            [Note:] You could also double the amount and cook it in a 24-26 cm grill/frying pan. One rice cooker cup of rice is about 180 ml."
- "Step 37            You can substitute the &#34;A&#34; shrimp with clams or mussels, or use both. It&#39;s essential that the ingredients release juice for the broth."
