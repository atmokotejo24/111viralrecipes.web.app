- "Step 2            In a pot or frying pan, heat enough oil for deep frying. Fry wings in small batches in hot oil until lightly browned. To avoid a very dried wings, do not fry too long. Once it is lightly browned, remove and drain on paper towel. Serve with rice."

For grilling and oven baking, Season wings (when boiling) with sufficient amount of salt or chicken seasoning powder/bullion (to taste). For deep frying, Boiled wings should taste saltier, with slightly more salt or chicken bullion/seasoning powder added to the pot."
