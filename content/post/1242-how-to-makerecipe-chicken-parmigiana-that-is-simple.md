##### The ingredients needed to make Chicken Parmigiana:

1. Make ready 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1. Get 1/2 onion, chopped
1. Get 2 cloves garlic, chopped
1. Prepare 1/4 cup fresh parsley
1. Take 1/4 cup fresh basil
1. Prepare 1/4 cup fresh oregano
1. Prepare 16 oz tomato paste
1. Get 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1. Take 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1. Make ready  salt
1. Make ready 2 tbsp pepper
1. Take 1 box uncooked spaghetti
1. Take 1 tbsp salt

1. Prepare 3/4 cup grated mozzarella cheese


BUT often times, chicken comes out too dry, or doesn&#39;t have enough flavour or seasoning. The sauce is bland, or cheddar cheese is used instead of mozzarella, etc. Chicken Parmigiana is an Italian-American all-time favorite, and my grandchildren are no exception. But this is a more contemporary version of the classic: instead of coating a thin, breaded and fried chicken cutlet with tomato sauce, I like to top the chicken with slices of fresh tomatoes and slices of fresh mozzarella or Fontina cheese.

Chicken Parmigiana is an Italian-American all-time favorite, and my grandchildren are no exception. But this is a more contemporary version of the classic: instead of coating a thin, breaded and fried chicken cutlet with tomato sauce, I like to top the chicken with slices of fresh tomatoes and slices of fresh mozzarella or Fontina cheese. Serve them over pasta or with a crisp green salad and plenty of garlic bread. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Place cutlets between two pieces of parchment or plastic wrap.
