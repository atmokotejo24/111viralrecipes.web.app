recipeingredient:
- "1 whole roasting chicken"
- "250 g fresh mango slices chopped about 1 large mango"
- "1 serrano chili chopped"
- " Juice of 12 lime"
- "1 tbsp fish sauce"
- "1 tbsp honey"
- "1/4 tsp ground allspice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            The day prior, season the chicken with salt (don&#39;t forget the inside of the bird). Leave the chicken uncovered in your fridge overnight. This will allow the salt to penetrate and flavour the meat, while also keeping it moist."
- "Step 2            In a blender, blitz the mango, chili, and lime into a puree. Run it through a mesh sieve into a small pot. Put the pot on medium-high heat and add the fish sauce, honey and allspice. Taste it and add more honey and/or salt as needed. Simmer for 5 minutes to reduce slightly. Remove the pot from the heat to cool."
- "Step 3            Once cooled to room temperature, spread half the marinade on the chicken. Put the chicken back in the fridge for 1 hour."
- "Step 4            Preheat your oven to 375 F. Truss the chicken, then put it on a wire rack on a baking tray and brush it with a little veg oil. Roast for 1 to 1 1/2 hrs until a meat thermometer registers 165 F. I usually measure both the breast and thigh to be sure. Keep an eye on the chicken while it cooks. It will burn a little due to the sugar, so don&#39;t worry too much, but if it gets too dark use a piece of foil to tent it."
- "Step 5            Brush the remaining marinade onto the chicken and roast uncovered a final minute or two so it gets sticky. Pull the chicken from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before carving."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
