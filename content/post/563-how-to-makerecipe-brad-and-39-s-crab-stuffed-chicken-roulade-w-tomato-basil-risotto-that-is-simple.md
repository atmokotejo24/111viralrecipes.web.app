Place on a plate and Sprinkle with the seasonings listed for the chicken. Repeat with all of the chicken thighs. Stack on the plate and season each layer. Set aside in fridge for 20 minutes."
- "Step 2            While chicken is marinating, prepare asparagus. Cut 1/3 off the bottom of the bunches. Discard. Place in a 8x8 baking dish. Cover with the rest of the ingredients and mix well with your hands. Set aside."
- "Step 3            Prep ingredients for the risotto. Chop onion, basil, and tomato."
- "Step 4            Prepare the roulade stuffing. Mix crab meat, shredded jack cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream in a medium mixing bowl. Refrigerate when done."
- "Step 5            Place 1 chicken thigh on a cutting board. Place a slice of prosciutto on top. Evenly spread crab mixture on 3/4 of it. Roll up and secure with toothpicks. Repeat with all pieces."
- "Step 6            Add the tomato and basil to a blender. Liquefy. Add to a saucepot. Add water, vinegar, bouillon, bay leaves, and Italian seasoning. Bring to a simmer and simmer 10 minutes. Keep hot. And discard Bay leaves."
- "Step 7            You can either deep fry the chicken or bake it. I chose to bake mine. Bread chicken with egg and chicken fry seasoning. Roll the roulades in fry seasoning, then egg, then back into fry seasoning. Either place in a greased baking dish for baking, or on a plate if frying. If baking, bake at 375 for 40 - 50 minutes. If frying, fry in 350 degree oil for 6-8 minutes. Either way chicken needs to reach 160 degrees internal temperature."
- "Step 8            If baking the chicken, the asparagus only needs half of that time in the oven. About 20-25 minutes. If frying drain chicken on paper towels."
- "Step 9            If baking, start risotto when it goes into the oven. If frying start risotto before frying chicken. Add olive oil to a large hot frying pan. Add onion and saute until it starts to caramelize. Add garlic and saute 2 more minutes."
- "Step 10            Add rice to the pan. Saute the rice in the onions until rice kernels start to toast and become aromatic. Add liquid 1 cup at a time. Stirring constantly. Let rice absorb most of the liquid before adding more. When you add the last cup of broth, add butter and pecorino. Stir until risotto has a smooth consistency and the rice is tender."
- "Step 11            Whether you deep fried or baked the chicken, when it reaches 160 degrees internal, add the sliced cheese on top. Place in the oven on broil until the cheese becomes bubbly and just starts to brown."
- "Step 12            Plate the risotto. Add the chicken roulade on top. Drape a few sprigs of asparagus over and garnish with a lemon wedge. The lemon is meant to be squeezed over the entire dish. Serve immediately. Enjoy."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
