- "Step 8            Step 8: Now add tomatoes (200 gms). I used half a tomato can into the pan. Now add salt to taste to the pan and cook really well. The colour should be really intense and dark. It took me 20 minutes of cooking the tomatoes till the oil seperated."
- "Step 9            Step 8.5: Pre heat the oven at Max. While tomatoes are cooking and are half way through add your marinated chicken to the oven grill. I grilled at Max for 10 minutes."

Cook for 7-8 minutes and add grilled chicken to it and on high flame mix the chicken and the gravy in the pan. Add the Jus on the grill tray to the pan as well. Cook for 5 - 7 minutes on medium flame and now add cubed onions and capsicum with the remaining kadhai mix masala."
- "Step 11            Step 10: Cook the chicken for another 15 minutes with cover on pot. You can add water to make it with gravy. I did not because I like my Kadhai chicken with thick gravy. In the end add kastoori methi and 1 tbsp cooking cream. Stop cooking and mix well."
