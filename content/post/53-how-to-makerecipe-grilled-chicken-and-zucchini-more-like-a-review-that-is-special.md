recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Can&#39;t take credit for the seasoning! Seen these at the store so I thought I&#39;d give them a try the flavors were nice and robust!! Used the Cavender&#39;s on the chicken and the Watkins on the zucchini. Brush chicken and zucchini with olive oil and season!"
- "Step 2            Started chicken first &#34;turning turning turning&#34; every 15 minutes for about an hour! that&#39;s the smokeless grill by Hamilton Beach. Best one I&#39;ve ever owned!!"
- "Step 3            Then the zucchini in the last ten minutes or so of the chicken being done! Zucchini tends to get quite mushy when over cooked!"
- "Step 4            Use a instant read thermometer insert into the thickest part of the chicken making sure not to touch bone. Your looking for 165 degrees! You Can get one of these for about 12 bucks. To make sure it&#39;s calibrated correctly put in a glass with ice water for ten minutes should read 33 degrees."
