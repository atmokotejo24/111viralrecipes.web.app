- "1 fresh coconut"
- "1 fresh lemon juice from approx 4 lg lemons"

- "1 jalapeno pepper finely minced adjust amount to personal preference"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Mix together the Finadene sauce ingredients and let sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours for the flavors to blend."
- "Step 2            Marinate the chicken in the Finadene sauce overnight. Broil chicken, basting with the sauce, until done. Cool, debone and shred. NOTE: Tastes best when the chicken is cooked on a BBQ grill, to get a bit of char on it, but you can broil in your oven if necessary."
- "Step 3            Drain the liquid from the coconut and save. Grate the coconut meat in a food processor. Squeeze the milk from the shredded coconut into a bowl."
- "Step 4            Mix the coconut milk with an equal amount of lemon juice and chill. Don&#39;t try substituting dried packaged shredded coconut. Only works with FRESH coconut."
- "Step 5            NOTE: For this amount of chicken, I use 3/4 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice and an equal amount of coconut milk; as 1 coconut won&#39;t generally give you that much coconut milk, add canned coconut milk and adjust the lemon to your taste."
- "Step 6            Toss together the green onions, grated coconut, jalapenos and shredded chicken. Slowly stir in the coconut milk &amp; lemon juice mixture, stirring well."
- "Step 7            Serve warm over rice or in pita bread."
- "Step 8            NOTE: I particularly love this as a cold chicken salad! I increase the amount of the lemon juice &amp; coconut milk dressing and mix the finished Kelaguen with an equal amount of wild rice. Chill and enjoy. Very refreshing!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
