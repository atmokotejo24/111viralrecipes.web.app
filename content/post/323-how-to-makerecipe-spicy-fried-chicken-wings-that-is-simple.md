recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Put your chicken wings in a large bowl. In a small bowl, combine the paprika, 1½ tablespoons of dried red chili flakes, white pepper, ground Sichuan peppercorns, cumin, salt, and sugar and mix thoroughly."
- "Step 2            To the chicken wings, add half of the spice mixture and the Shaoxing wine, and mix thoroughly with your hands until the chicken wings are evenly coated. Cover, and let the wings marinate in the refrigerator overnight (a full 24 hours is even better)."

The wings should be very lightly coated with a thin batter."

- "Step 5            After all of the wings are fried, return them to the oil in batches fry a second time for 2 minutes each batch--until they turn golden brown and crispy. Transfer the wings to a stainless steel bowl and sprinkle in the remaining spice mixture. Toss the wings until they are well coated!"
- "Step 6            If you like, per standard practice with fried food, feel free to add more salt to taste before serving!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
