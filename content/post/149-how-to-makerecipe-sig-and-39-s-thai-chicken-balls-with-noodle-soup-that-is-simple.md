Chicken noodle soup with white and dark meat chicken. I enjoyed this Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and add curry paste. Add chicken stock, coconut milk, bok choy, cilantro, fish sauce, and honey; stir until well combined. It starts with ginger-scented chicken-cilantro meatballs that are browned, then simmered in a fragrant coconut milk broth that&#39;s inspired by tom kha gai, a Thai chicken-coconut soup.
