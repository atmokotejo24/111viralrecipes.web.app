- "2 large chicken breasts about 15 lb"
- "4 teaspoons baking soda"
- "3 carrots"
- "1 red bell pepper"
- "1 mediumsized sweet onion"
- "1 sweet potato"
- "1 large potato or 3 to 4 small ones"
- "1/2 package or one foilsealed square portion 110 g Golden Curry"
- "4 Tablespoons ketchup"
- " Cooked Rice for serving"
- "2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Gather your ingredients. Wash all the vegetables, and peel the carrots, potato, onion, and sweet potato."
- "Step 2            Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.  For more tender chicken, sprinkle with the baking soda and let the chicken sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. Rinse the chicken thoroughly, and pat it dry.  If you like, you can season the chicken with a small amount of salt and pepper before frying it. I used 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper."
- "Step 3            Prepare the other ingredients. Chop the potatoes, carrots, and sweet potatoes to bite-sized pieces. Chop the onions and bell pepper.  I cut up the curry block into small pieces to help it dissolve better."
- "Step 4            Brown the chicken in a small amount (~2 to 3 teaspoons) oil. To ensure even browning, fry in batches and don‚Äôt crowd the pan.  Fry the chicken until browned, but don‚Äôt cook it all the way through. It will finish cooking in the pot."
- "Step 5            Transfer the chicken, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and carrots to a large pot with a lid. Add enough water to barely cover everything. Heat to boiling then reduce the heat to a simmer."
- "Step 6            While the pot warms up, saut√© the peppers and onions in a small amount of oil until they are slightly softened."
- "Step 7            Transfer the pepper and onions to the larger pot, give it a good sir, then cover and allow to simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, check the doneness of the potato, carrots, and sweet potato. If they need additional cooking time to soften, allow the pot to simmer more, checking every five minutes."
- "Step 8            Add the curry, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce,mix well, and allow to simmer again, uncovered, for about 10 minutes, or until thickened."
- "Step 9            You can continue simmering for an additional 5 minutes if you like your curry thicker. Serve over rice."
- "Step 10            Notes: üçõ. Golden Curry is sold in different levels of spiciness (Mild, Medium Hot, Hot, and Extra Hot). I use Mild so that my five year old will eat it.  üçõ. Other root vegetables, like parsnip or turnip, will also work well in this dish."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
