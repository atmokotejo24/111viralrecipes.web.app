Honey Balsamic Glazed Chicken is a healthy and secretly easy-to-make recipe that will leave your guests in awe with how impressive it looks! Chicken rests in a balsamic vinegar and honey marinade, then is cooked in a cast-iron skillet or seared on the grill. The chicken is marinated in a simple sauce of balsamic vinegar, honey, olive oil, garlic powder and thyme, baked until succulent then broiled until the skins are slightly charred. There&#39;s a ton of sauce to go around to soak up the rice or mashed potatoes you pair it with.
