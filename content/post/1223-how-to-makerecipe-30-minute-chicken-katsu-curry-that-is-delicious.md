- "2 eggs"
- "1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs"
- "300 ml vegetable oil"
- "Pinch salt and pepper"
- "2 cubes golden curry sauce"
- "250 ml water for curry sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Firstly get your 2 cups of rice rinsed and cooking in 2 cups of water. I’m lucky to have a rice cooker but bringing the water to a boil then simmering in a covered pan on the stove for 25 mins should work well."
- "Step 2            Next, tenderize the chicken by covering with cling film and tapping with a flat headed mallet until about half the original thickness"
- "Step 3            Pour your oil into a deep pan and bring up to a high heat. Be careful here! Always keep an eye on hot oil"
- "Step 4            You’ll need 3 shallow dishes now for preparing the katsu. Evenly cover one with flour, one with the egg and the other with panko crumbs. Whisk the eggs with a fork"
- "Step 5            Having lightly salted and peppered the chicken, gently dip them each side into first the flour, next the egg and last the panko. Make sure you well coat them with egg so the breadcrumbs stick well"
- "Step 6            Make sure the oil is hot, very carefully lay one of the chicken breasts into the oil. Very carefully!"
- "Step 7            Remove the chicken when it’s nicely browned, should be 3-4 minutes. Repeat the last step for the other breast, then set them both to one side on some kitchen roll to drain a little. Slice into 1 cm strips"
- "Step 8            Now bring 250 ml water to the boil and add 2 golden curry cubes, stirring for about a minute."
- "Step 9            Your rice should just about be done now so check on that and fluff with a fork and put a serving on one plate. Lay out the chicken on the side and pour over the curry sauce and serve!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
