- "Step 2            Place the thighs in vaccum sealed bags. Face them all in the same direction and place your rosemary snd sage on the side of the leg where there is no skine covering. Placing the herb on the exposed flesh will help to season the meat and not just the skin. Sprinkle some olive oil over top the chicken. Then seal."
- "Step 3            Place bag/bags in preheated sous vide bags. Cook for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Yes that&#39;s my homemade sous vide machine. The circulator was in sale for $150 and the cooler costs $25.

- "Step 6            Chop your shallot, garlic clove, and rosemary, pour 1 tbsp of gelatin over your chicken stock and set aside. Remove the chicken from the fridge and reseason if you think too much of the seasoning was washed away while cooking. Put a tbsp of olive oil into a cast iron pan and heat over medium high until smoking."
- "Step 7            Add the chicken, skin down to the pan. Use another pan to keep weight on the chicken while it cooks, so you can get maximum brownage. You&#39;re look at about 2 minutes per side."
- "Step 8            When complete throw your shallot, rosemary and garlic in the still hot pan. Cook until fragrant."
- "Step 9            Then pour your chicken stock and the reserved juices from your vacuum nag into the pot. Using a wooden spatula scrape up any browned bits that may be stuck to the bottom of the pan. Cook over medium high heat until reduced to about 2/3&#39;s the original volume."
- "Step 10            Add soy sauce, lemon juice, sherry wine, white wine vinegar and butter. Boil rapidly until you have a smooth creamy sauce. Dip a spoon into your pan sauce, if it coats the back of the spoon you&#39;re good to go. If not keep boiling."
- "Step 11            Run the pan sauce through a fine mesh strainer or chinois. You can press down on the bits stuck in the strainer to get some really tasty juice back into you pan sauce."
- "Step 12            Serve the pan sauce over chicken and enjoy you&#39;re fancy sous vide chicken."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
