recipeingredient:
- "2 whole chickens 35 lbs each"
- "1 orange"
- "1 lemon"
- "2 sprigs rosemary"
- "4 sprigs tarragon"
- "4 cups sugar"
- "3 cups kosher salt"
- "6 dried bay leaves"
- "1 tbsp chopped dehydrated onion"
- "1 tsp whole pepper corns"
- "3 gallons water"
- " BBQ Chicken Rub Mix"
- " All purpose seasoning"
- "1 cup salt 12 cup granulated garlic 14 cup pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Combine the kosher salt, sugar, bay leaves, pepper and chopped dehydrated onion into the 3 gallons of water. Soak the chickens in the refrigerator overnight."
- "Step 2            Get smoker heating to 325°. I have an offset barrel smoker that I modified to use a water bath. I did not add water to the pan because I was worried that might make the skin rubbery."
- "Step 3            Rinse chicken in cold water and pat dry."
- "Step 4            Cut the orange and lemon into 1/8 wedges."
- "Step 5            Stuff each chicken with half an orange, half a lemon, 1 sprig rosemary and 2 sprigs of tarragon."
- "Step 6            Cover all sides of the chickens with the AP rub and BBQ chicken rub."
- "Step 7            Place the chickens in the smoker breast side down. I&#39;m using a charcoal, maple wood and peach wood combination. I have an abundance of maples on my property which gives a nice sweet smoke and used peach chips that I bought as another sweet smoke to balance the charcoal."
- "Step 8            After 1 hour check the temp of the white and dark meat. You&#39;re looking for 165 in the white and 175 in the dark. With my smoker I wasnt there, about 2 hours or so away."
- "Step 9            Brush the skin with oil and rotate in the smoker to ensure an even cook. You can use any oil you like, olive would give it a nice fruity flavor. I used canola for the neutral flavor plus it&#39;s what I had on hand, next time I will try peanut oil because it&#39;s amazing!"
- "Step 10            After one more hour rotate the chickens and check the skins to see if they need oiled again."
- "Step 11            When the temps are good pull the chickens and let rest about half an hour before carving."
- "Step 12            The skins on my chickens cracked and started to pull away. I think 325° was too hot. My goal was for them to only cook for 2 hours but the dark meat was not temping. I contemplated tenting with foil to protect the skin but wasn&#39;t sure what it would do to the texture. Next time I&#39;ll stick with my original temp of 275° and cook longer brushing multiple times with peanut oil... it tastes so amazing so I&#39;m not at all disappointed, plus I get to keep cooking this recipe over and over to get it right!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
