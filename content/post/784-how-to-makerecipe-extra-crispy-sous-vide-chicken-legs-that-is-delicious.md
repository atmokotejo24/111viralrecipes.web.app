Remove the chicken from the fridge and reseason if you think too much of the seasoning was washed away while cooking. Put a tbsp of olive oil into a cast iron pan and heat over medium high until smoking."

- "Step 8            When complete throw your shallot, rosemary and garlic in the still hot pan. Cook until fragrant."
- "Step 9            Then pour your chicken stock and the reserved juices from your vacuum nag into the pot. Using a wooden spatula scrape up any browned bits that may be stuck to the bottom of the pan. Cook over medium high heat until reduced to about 2/3&#39;s the original volume."
