recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Season chicken thighs liberally with salt pepper garlic."
- "Step 2            Preheat oven to 375°. Heat a large oven safe pan with sides on medium heat with the olive oil. Place chicken in the pan skin side down The pan does not need to be ripping hot when the chicken goes in. Cook until well browned and the skin is very crispy. Flip chicken and cook for another couple minutes to get a little color. Remove chicken and set aside."
- "Step 3            If there is a lot of rendered chicken fat remove all but 2 tbsp. Add diced onions and cook for 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another two minutes. Until onions and garlic have softened"
- "Step 4            Add all the tomatoes and lightly smash about half of them keeping the rest intact. Cook for another 3 minutes. Add wine, bring to a heavy simmer and scrape any bits from the bottom of the pan. Add parsley, thyme, rosemary, and let wine reduce with the tomato liquid for a few minutes until reduced by 1/3-1/2."
- "Step 5            Add chicken stock and lemon juice. Bring back to a simmer and let simmer for 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the liquid is leaning too heavy on the acidic side add a few dashes of fish sauce to balance with savoriness."
- "Step 6            Add the chicken thighs back in skin side up. The liquid should come up a good portion of the sides of the chicken but not cover the skin. Place the pan in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the chicken thighs have reached temp."
- "Step 7            Remove the pan from the oven and let everything settle for 5-10 minutes. Top with additional parsley, lemon zest and flaky sea salt. Serve with rice to soak up the sauce."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
