- "Step 10            Reheat broth bowls in microwave as hot as you possibly can. You&#39;ll want your broth almost bubbling. Remember, your guests will be dipping cooled noodles and chicken, chilled vegetables and condiments in it and you&#39;ll want the heated temperature to last."
- "Step 11            Have your guests place chicken slices in their bowls first to moisten them. [or cook them if you&#39;ve chosen raw, thin sliced meats or seafood] Then have them add noodles, sides and condiments. Or, allow them pull noodles, meat or veggies directly from the serving plates one by one and dip before they eat."
- "Step 12            Authors Notes: The bottom line to this dish is, make certain your broth is piping hot and everything else is  somewhat room temperature. Also, this dish can easily serve four. Just add additional broth, not water. Lastly, if you find your noodles are drying up a bit before serving, wet your clean hand under water and flick water on them. They&#39;ll moisten right up! Enjoy!"
