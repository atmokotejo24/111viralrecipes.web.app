recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Get 1 1/2 T of the butter and 1/2 T of bacon grease (or olive oil or more butter if using instead) heated in a pan over medium high heat."
- "Step 2            Season your chicken on both sides with desired amount of seasoned salt (or regular salt, you boring person you) and pepper."
- "Step 3            When the butter is hot, fry up your chicken, letting it brown on both sides and make sure it cooks all the way through. Remove chicken, leave delicious brown bits in your pan. Cut up the chicken now or after it has cooled for a bit."
- "Step 4            &#34;De-glaze&#34; the pan (it probably still has tons of oil and not much stuck-on brown bits, but that&#39;s ok) with the wine, pouring slowly (and standing far away so you don&#39;t get spattered with boiling hot oil!) and whisking constantly. Feel free to add more if you wish."
- "Step 5            Let the wine cook for a bit, probably a minute or two, to cook out some alcohol. Add the minced shallot and garlic."
- "Step 6            Now ditch the whisk and use a wooden spoon. Turn heat down to medium; stir the shallot and garlic around for a while, cook until browning and fragrant."
- "Step 7            Note- now is probably a good time to boil some pasta, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re having with this sauce."
- "Step 8            Add the rest of the butter. Let it melt and cook for an additional minute or so."
- "Step 9            Slowly add the heavy cream while stirring. Side note- if you would like to make more sauce, there is enough shallot and garlic to double the cream and parmesan without messing with any other ingredients. You may need a little more seasonings at the end, but that is all done to taste anyways."
- "Step 10            Let the mixture heat up and reduce for a few minutes, stirring frequently/constantly. You want to give it some time to thicken up, but not get too gloopy."
- "Step 11            Add the parmesan, stirring around until completely melted."
- "Step 12            Cut up the chicken (if you haven&#39;t already done so) and add it back to the sauce."
- "Step 13            Season the sauce with a little salt (parmesan is pretty salty already, don&#39;t be too heavy handed), lots of pepper, and the nutmeg. Taste, and decide if/what additional seasonings to add. Add any other additional ingredients and let them warm through."
- "Step 14            Mix the pasta right in, or spoon desired amount over individual pasta servings, whichever your little heart desires. If the sauce gets too thick, feel free to add a little milk or pasta water to thin it out."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
