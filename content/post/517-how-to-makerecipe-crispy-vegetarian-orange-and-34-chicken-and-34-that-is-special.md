- "2 tbsp white vinegar"
- "1 clove garlic finely minced"
- "1 tsp ginger finely minced grated or paste"

- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1 cup cornstarch"
- "2 cup vegetable oil or more for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Mix miso paste with warm water until completely dissolved. Add the orange juice, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar. Mix well."
- "Step 2            Heat the sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper. Saut√© until fragrant. Be careful! It&#39;ll brown quickly!"
- "Step 3            Add the orange juice &amp; miso mixture to the saucepan. Mix well and bring to a simmer."
- "Step 4            While bringing sauce to a simmer, mix together 1 tbsp cornstarch with 3 tbsp cool water to form a thin mixture. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce. Simmer until thickened. Cover and set sauce to the side."
- "Step 5            Beat salt and eggs together. Take a few pieces of seitan and dip into the whisked eggs, then dredge in cornstarch. Make sure all of the pieces are coated well. Complete the dredging process on the rest of the seitan."
- "Step 6            Heat oil in a dutch oven or large frying pan. Test the hot oil by dropping in a small piece of the seitan. Once the ideal temperature is reached, fry in batches. The size of your batches will depend on the size of your frying pan (I do two using my large dutch oven). Fry until golden brown; 1-2 minutes per side. Place fried seitan on paper towels to drain excess oil."
- "Step 7            Once all the seitan has been fried and drained, place in a large bowl. Drizzle the warm orange glaze over the seitan and toss well. Serve over rice and garnish with fresh scallions."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
