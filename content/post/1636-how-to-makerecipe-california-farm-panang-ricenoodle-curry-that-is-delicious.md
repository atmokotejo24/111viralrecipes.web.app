Broccoli, peppers, mini corn, water chestnuts, peas, whatever - it&#39;s all delicious when it&#39;s covered in this thick, vibrant panang curry. But unlike most other curry recipes, you cannot reduce the spiciness without losing flavour because chillies are the key ingredient for Penang curry sauce. Thais would class this Panang curry as medium or &#34;not so spicy&#34;.
