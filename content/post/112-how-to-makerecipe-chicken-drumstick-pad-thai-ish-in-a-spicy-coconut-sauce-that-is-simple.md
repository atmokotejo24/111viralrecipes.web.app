- "Step 8            Add the aromatics except the Thai basil and the coriander and sweat for a little while. Add the rice wine, the two soy sauces and half the lemon juice. Also add the coconut milk"
- "Step 9            Top up with hot water and simmer on a low heat for around 45 minutes."
- "Step 10            Add half the freshly chopped green herbs reserving half for garnish.  Don&#39;t let the pot dry out. Keep adding water if necessary. Remember, you need fluid and space for the noodles. Add the pad thai noodles. Simmer for a few more minutes until the noodles are cooked and add the remaining lemon juice.   Garnish with the herbs and diagonally chopped spring onions.  Serve as a dish, among others. I&#39;m frying yesterday&#39;s rice in sesame oil and fresh ginger as a side dish."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
