recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Mix the ingredients for the marinate. You may want to add a few tablespoon of water if the mixture is too thick. Taste and adjust for salt as needed."
- "Step 2            Score the chicken and combine with the marinate mixture. Make sure to have the mixture under the skin and marinate overnight for maximum flavor. This will also make the chicken tender and moist."
- "Step 3            Fry the onion until brown and almost crisp. Make sure not to burn or it may become bitter. Set aside."
- "Step 4            Wash the basmati rice thrice to remove excess starch. Soak in water for 30 minutes then drain."
- "Step 5            In a pot, boil about 1 liter of water and add salt, oil and the whole spices. Let simmer for 5 minutes to release the flavors of the spices."
- "Step 6            Add the basmati rice. Cook until 75% done (see packaging direction). The rice has to be undercooked, with the middle still grainy to touch. This will continue to be cooked once we assemble the biryani dish. Drain."
- "Step 7            While the rice is draining and still hot, place the chicken in a single layer in a heavy bottom pot. Top with 1/3 of the fried onion, chopped coriander, and 2 tablespoon of the oil used to fry the garlic."
- "Step 8            Cover with half of the rice. The rice should not be dripping with water nor too dry. Level the rice then top with 1/3 of the fried onion, coriander and sprinkle with a few pinch of biryani masala or garam masala powder."
- "Step 9            Cover with the remaining rice. Level it and too with the remaining fried onion, coriander and sprinkle with a few pinch of biryani masala or garam masala powder."
- "Step 10            Put about 2 tablespoon of ghee and the saffron/turmeric milk mixture divided across the top."
- "Step 11            Place an aluminum foil or damp cloth to trap the moisture and cover with a heavy lid."
- "Step 12            Place a griddle on the stove and set flame at medium high. Place the biryani pot on top of it and cook for 20 minutes. Then lower the heat to very low and cook for another 20 minutes.  In the last 10 minutes of the cook, I removed the griddle and let the flame directly touch the biryani pot."
- "Step 13            Turn off heat and let rest for at least 20 minutes before opening and serving."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
