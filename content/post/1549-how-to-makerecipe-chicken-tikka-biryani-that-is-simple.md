recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Let’s start making Chicken Tikka first, for that, rinse the chicken pieces very well in running water and keep them aside. Take a big bowl and mix all the ingredients together. Now make 2-3 deep slits on each piece of chicken and apply the marinade on them. The slitting ensures that the flavor from the marinade goes all the way into the chicken, and also helps with quick and even cooking."
- "Step 2            Refrigerate covered preferably overnight for best results, but even keeping it up to 4-6 hours, then too is ok. Take out the chicken from the refrigerator and bring it on room temperature. Preheat the oven at 375F / 190C and thread the chicken pieces on to the skewers. You will be able to make either 1 big skewer or 2 small skewers from this much quantity. Place the chicken skewers on to the grill. Keep an oven tray or a foil paper underneath to catch any drippings which will be used later"
- "Step 3            Let’s start making gravy now. Now heat 2 tablespoon of oil in another pan and add all the spices. Stir fry, till the raw flavor goes away, and then add 1 finely chopped green chili and 1 finely chopped onion. Stir fry for few seconds and then quickly add chopped tomato. Cook till tomato turns little mushy. Stir in 1/4 cup of fresh and whipped yogurt."
- "Step 4            Cook together until the oil is released from the sides and then add reserved marinade as well as the drippings from the chicken and cook until the gravy is thick and cooked through."
- "Step 5            Let’s start preparing rice now. Rinse 2 cups basmati rice in running water and soak them for about 20 minutes. Bring 4 cups of water on few boils, add soaked rice, 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1 bay leaf and some salt. Cook till the rice are about 3/4 done, remove and strain all the water."
- "Step 6            Now let’s start assembling the chicken tikka biryani. First put half the rice back into the pan, sprinkle some Tikka Masala on top of it, sprinkle the handful of reserved fried onions and some chopped fresh coriander, again make a layer of rice to cover the masala."
- "Step 7            Then drizzle about 1 tbsp of oil and the saffron water. Add remaining chicken tikka with gravy, make a last layer of rice, sprinkle a bit of orange color on one side,"
- "Step 8            Spread some more fried onions and chopped coriander and mint leaves."
- "Step 9            Steam this on low heat for 5-6 minutes or put in a 180 C preheated oven for about the same time. This tends to infuse the lovely biryani flavor into the rice as it steams. Serve hot!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
