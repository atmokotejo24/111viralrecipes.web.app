recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            If looking to decrease the manual labor time on this recipe, try my 1 Minute Green Chili Enchilada Sauce. It&#39;ll work well in a pinch.                                Mike&#39;s 1 Minute Green Chile Enchilada Sauce"
- "Step 2            You can slightly brown or sear your roast in a cast iron skillet with oil prior to placing it in your crock pot but it&#39;s not necessary."
- "Step 3            Place pork in a slow cooker and add everything in the pork and green chili sauce section [excluding] the corn starch and baking soda. Let slow cook for 7 + hours."
- "Step 4            Chop all vegetables for garnishments and place in fridge to chill."
- "Step 5            When pork is soft enough to be pulled apart by fingers or forks, take out and shread. Set aside and keep warm at room temperature."
- "Step 6            Pour all pork fluid and cooked vegetables in a blender and blend in high until fully liquefied. Rinse blender and put away."
- "Step 7            Pull out your bag of Mexican 3 Cheese Blend and allow it to come to room temperature for later use."
- "Step 8            Pour green chili blended mixture into a sauce pan and heat on stove top."
- "Step 9            At boiling point, taste for acidity levels. If there is a bitterness from the Tomatillos, add 1/4 tsp baking soda and stir. Your mixture will foam momentarily but don&#39;t worry. Taste again. If still too acidic, add one more 1/4 tsp baking soda. Also taste test for a flavors you desire but have faded. Much of the spices can wear down with such a long cook time so ask yourself if you&#39;d like more garlic, onion powder, pepper, salt, Cilantro or Cumin. Make this recipe your own. :0)"
- "Step 10            To thicken this green chili sauce, bring to a boil. Measure 2 tbs Corn Starch with 1 tbs water and mix very well [in a tiny bowl] and slowly add it to your boiling sauce. As it boils it will thicken. Add another tablespoon with water and mix in your tiny bowl again if still too thin. Since this sauce will go over your Chimichangas, you&#39;ll want it thick enough so it doesn&#39;t destroy or sog the crisp of your tortilla."
- "Step 11            Mix about 10 tbs of this sauce into your shreadded pork and mix well. You don&#39;t want your pork too wet tho. It&#39;ll break through your tortilla before you can fry it."
- "Step 12            Make your bean mixture with your salsa, cumin, onion powder and chili&#39;s and microwave for 2 minutes. Stir well and set to the side."
- "Step 13            To make your Chimichangas, heat 6 tortillas for 10 seconds in the microwave. Place pork in the center of the tortilla, the pile the beans on top then stack the cheese. In that order. Smash all 3 down slightly to compress or firm ingredients."
- "Step 14            Fold over both sides of the tortilla and pin with a toothpick."
- "Step 15            Take end and fold tips right to left and inwards, like a gift and pin with a toothpick."
- "Step 16            Do the same for the other open end."
- "Step 17            Make 6 of these Chimichangas the same way and size."
- "Step 18            Fill frying pan half way up with oil and turn on."
- "Step 19            Once hot, add a Chimichanga to the heated oil and fry 1 1/2 minutes on each side. These require such a short fry time since all ingredients are precooked or are at room temperature. If you can&#39;t fry your Chimichanga for a minute and a half on each side without burning, your heat is too high. You&#39;ll only want to flip these over once if at all possible. Do not burn and drain on several paper towels once crispy and golden brown."
- "Step 20            Fry one by one and be careful when flipping these Chimichangas while in the hot oil. They are heavy and oil will splash out if not very careful! Repeat for all 6 Chimichangas."
- "Step 21            To plate: REMOVE ALL 18 TOOTHPICKS! Place shreadded cabbage at the base of the plate for the fried Chimichanga to sit upon. Otherwise the sauce that settles on the plate bottom will make your Chimichanga too soggy too soon."
- "Step 22            Using the cabbage bed is an old trick used by restaurants to cool the Chimichangas and ensure your leftovers are just as crispy as they were at platter service."
- "Step 23            Top with all garnishments, additional shreadded cheese and green sauce and serve immediately."
- "Step 24            This recipe should create 6 Chimichangas weighing about 2 + pounds a piece."
- "Step 25            You can also create mini Chimichangas with 6&#34; Tortillas. Just follow the same recipe."
- "Step 26            There really isn&#39;t a need to serve a side dish with these since you already have your bread, [tortillas] meat, beans [protiens] and vegetables. But if you&#39;re looking for another starch, try Mexican - Spanish Rice. Or try a dessert such as Tres Leches Cake. [Mexican 3 Milk Cake]"
- "Step 27            Enjoy!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
