recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Cut chicken into 1-1 ½ inch chunks."
- "Step 2            Thighs will cook up juicier, breasts have less fat. Season lightly with salt and pepper. If using kosher chicken meat, go light on the salt, as the meat will already have some saltiness."
- "Step 3            Place chicken pieces into a shallow bowl."
- "Step 4            Rinse and dry the eight rosemary stems, then pull most of the leaves from the stem. Reserve 1-2 inches of leaves at the tip of each stem. These are your skewers."
- "Step 5            In a small bowl, pour lemon juice, zest, olive oil, 1 tbsp whole grain Dijon mustard, honey, garlic and chopped rosemary leaves; mix well."
- "Step 6            Pour the marinade over the chicken pieces."

- "Step 8            Remove marinated chicken from the refrigerator. Skewer the chicken chunks onto four of the rosemary skewers. Reserve the other four skewers."
- "Step 9            Generously grease your grill before preheating to prevent the chicken from sticking. Grill the skewers over a medium flame for 5 minutes per side. Cover the chicken as it cooks so that smoky rosemary flavor permeates the meat."
- "Step 10            Turn the skewers periodically, until the chicken chunks are cooked through and the meat is evenly grilled. Cut a larger chunk open to check for doneness."
- "Step 11            When chicken is cooked, un-skewer the chicken chunks from the charred rosemary skewers. Re-skewer them on the fresh rosemary skewers."
- "Step 12            To make the Dijon Mayonnaise, combine mayonnaise and the remaining ½ tbsp whole grain Dijon mustard in a small bowl; stir well."
- "Step 13            Serve as a dipping sauce with the grilled chicken skewers."
