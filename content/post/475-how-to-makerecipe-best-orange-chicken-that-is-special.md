- "2-3 lbs chicken cut in pieces"
- "1 1/2 C pulpfree orange juice"
- "1/2 C honey"
- "1 tsp dry mustard"
- "2 tsp onion powder"
- "1 tblsp Worcestershire sauce"
- "2 tblsp cornstarch powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Dredge chicken in flour and fry lightly until just golden -do NOT use salt- then cover to keep warm and set aside...if you are using bone-in chicken the frying process will take a lot longer and frankly I don&#39;t recommend it"
- "Step 2            In a medium saucepan, combine orange juice and honey, whisk in the mustard and onion powder and Worcestershire...cook on medium high heat until it begins to bubble"
- "Step 3            Make a slurry of the cornstarch and a little cold water, stir into the sauce and continue cooking for a few minutes. You may need to add another teaspoon of slurry -the goal is to thicken the sauce so it coats the back of a spoon"
- "Step 4            Add the cooked chicken and turn to coat..I like to let it stay in the sauce long enough to get medium hot"
- "Step 5            And there you have it! There is plenty of sauce to both coat the chicken and have enough to drizzle over rice or noodles...ENJOY!! ❤️❤️"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
