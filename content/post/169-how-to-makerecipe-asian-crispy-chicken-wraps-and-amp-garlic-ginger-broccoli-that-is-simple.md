recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Floret your Broccoli and set stems into a steaming pot. Steam Broccoli on high for 3 minutes."
- "Step 2            While it steams, add water and ice to a bowl. Remove the Broccoli and place it in the ice water. Be sure to stir it around and stop the Broccoli from cooking any further. Save 1 Cup of the steamed Broccoli water."
- "Step 3            Preheat oven to 375째F. Butterfly your chicken for faster cooking and pat it dry. Place onto cookie sheet and oiled parchment paper. Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Place it in the oven for about 15 minutes or when it reaches an internal temperature of 165째F."
- "Step 4            Take chicken out and shred it with 2 forks or pulse it in the blender for a more minced chicken. While that pulses or your shred, preheat two pans over medium-high heat."
- "Step 5            In the first pan, we&#39;ll prep your Broccoli sauce. Add a bit of oil, then your garlic and ginger. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly."
- "Step 6            Next, add your Broccoli water, onion powder, soy sauce, mustard, oyster sauce, sriracha, sugar, sesame oil, black pepper and cook for a bit. Once cooked and all mixed together, add your corn starch.  Tip: add a bit of water to your cornstarch and Premix it to a paste. This will avoid any corn starch clumps."
- "Step 7            Cook until you get a thick texture, then add salt to taste. Remove your Broccoli and let it drip-dry. Mix it around with the sauce until its well coated and the Broccoli is fully re-heated."
- "Step 8            In your other pan, add about 1/4&#34;- 1/2&#34; amount of frying oil to your pan. Let it heat up and take out your roll filling."
- "Step 9            Lightly wet your rice paper with room temperature water. Just enough to allow you to fold or roll (I&#39;ll be folding like a crunch wrap). Note that overlaying 2 Rice Papers together will yield a crisper outer shell and hold together better. You can use one though if you prefer. Add your shredded chicken and vegetables on top."
- "Step 10            In a bowl, mix your spices and sauces (not your dumpling Dipping sauce). Drizzle a light amount of the mixture on top for a touch of flavour. Fold or roll everything together as desired."
- "Step 11            Fry the rolls/wraps (seam-side down) until crispy. Remove it all and garnish your wraps/rolls with herb leaves. Garnish your Broccoli with Sesame seeds and serve."
- "Step 12            Note: This dish also goes well with some rice, though I omitted it this time."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
