Tip 2:I made steamed rice, and added taco seasoning to the water and stir it before I put in my rice cooker. Tip 3: once rice is done, add your rice to your plate, top with the crockpot mixture, and you can top it with queso dip, shredded Mexican blend cheese, some of the green onions, and a lil fresh cilantro if you had any of the green onions and cilantro left. You can also just do this instead of adding the queso and shredded cheese to crockpot."
- "Step 7            Also, you can serve with rice as I listed above, tostitos, or cut some tortilla bread in triangles, or make a taco or quesadilla out of it."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
