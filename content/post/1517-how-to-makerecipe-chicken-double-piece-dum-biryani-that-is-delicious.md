- "Step 3            Marinate Chicken Bone-in for at least 2 hours or overnight with all the masalas along with the fried Onions and the Oil in which they are fried, which has been brought to the room temperature. Do not use the whole of it. Add it accordingly. If you took 3 cups of it for frying, then add 1 1/4 cups of it to the marination after thoroughly cooled."
- "Step 4            Before keeping it on dum, pour a tablespoon of Ghee on top along with either the Saffron infused Milk or dry Zafrani (Saffron) colour mixed in Milk. Add just about 2 pinches of it. You can even sprinkle some Coriander and Mint leaves finely chopped along with the fried Onions."

- "Step 6            Cover it well either by a wet thick Cotton cloth sealing the corners of the lid or the chapati dough. I always prefer a thick Cotton cloth. The cloth should be dipped in clean drinking water and wrunged well until all the water drips. Now wrap the lid of the vessel with this nicely covering the whole lid. Place it on the vessel. Keep the flame for the first 15 minutes on a high and keep rotating the vessel every now and then."
- "Step 7            Keep doing that so that it doesn&#39;t get burnt at the bottom. After 10 to 15 minutes. Bring the flame to low and let it simmer for at least 40-45 minutes further or even a little more if needed.."
- "Step 8            Do not open the lid at all. If possible seal it with a thick cotton cloth or the dough. Cover the mouth of the vessel with it and place the lid on top. This slow cooking process called Dum is the best for Biryanis and is the most perfect one. Aromatic and flavourful Biryani is ready in an hour. Enjoy!"
