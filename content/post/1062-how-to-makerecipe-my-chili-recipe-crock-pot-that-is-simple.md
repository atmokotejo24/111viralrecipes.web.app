An easy slow cooker chili recipe with Ground Beef, beans, tomato sauce, and the best homemade chili seasoning. It putters away in the slow cooker for the juiciest beef and rich flavor.. I just had to throw away my entire chili pot because I used dry beans, which apparently are dangerous unless cooked extremely well. The beef, bell pepper, onion, and garlic will all cook in the slow cooker, but browning the meat and sautéing the vegetables in a skillet before adding it to the slow cooker brings much more flavor to the chili.
