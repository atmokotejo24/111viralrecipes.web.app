- "4 chicken legs jointed into thighs and drumsticks                      How to joint chicken legs"
- "50 g butter"
- "2 white onions peeled"
- "2 cloves garlic peeled"
- " Olive oil"
- "2 peppers 1 red 1 green"
- "6 big tomatoes"
- "4 healthy sprigs of fresh thyme or rosemary oregano or a mix"
- " rice or potatoes andor bread to serve"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Roughly chop the onions, and fine dice the garlic. Keep separate."
- "Step 2            Heat 3 tbsp oil in a large ovenproof saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onions."
- "Step 3            Cook for 10 mins or so until starting to turn golden at the edges. Meanwhile..."
- "Step 4            Roughly chop the tomatoes and peppers. No need to be too precise."
- "Step 5            Add the chopped veg, garlic and herb sprigs to the pan. Season well with salt, then cover with a lid and reduce the heat to low."
- "Step 6            Simmer over a low heat for about 45 mins until everything has reduced and broken down. It will look something like this. Meanwhile..."
- "Step 7            Preheat the oven to 180C."

- "Step 9            Place in the oven for 15 to 20 mins so the skin is golden and crisp. It should not be cooked through at this point.   Browning the skin before adding it to your casserole will add delicious flavour and make sure the skin isn&#39;t soggy, but lovely and crisp."
- "Step 10            Remove the chicken from the oven. When the veg is ready, add the chicken to the pan, nestling them in so they&#39;re roughly in a single layer."
- "Step 11            Place the dish in the oven for another 30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.   To check the chicken is cooked, use tongs or a fork to remove a piece of chicken from the pan to a board or plate. Use a fork to keep it in place, then pierce the meat to the bone with the tip of a sharp knife. If the juices run clear, it’s cooked. Don’t worry if the meat around the bone is slightly darker or very slightly pink.   If there’s blood in the juices, it’s not cooked."
- "Step 12            Once the chicken is cooked, serve with rice or potatoes, a green salad and bread to mop up all those delicious juices."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
