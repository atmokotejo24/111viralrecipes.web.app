recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Fill a pot with your bones and add water til it just covers the bones. Boil for 20 min."
- "Step 2            While the water is coming to boil, roast your onions and ginger on a burner or in the oven under the broiler til its charred on both sides."
- "Step 3            After 20 min, dump the water and rinse the bones under cold water really good."
- "Step 4            In a very large stock pot, add your clean bones and your charred onions and ginger and fill the pot with at least twice as much water as there is bones or 3/4 of the way. Bring to boil."
- "Step 5            While that is coming to a boil, prepare your spices. On a dry skillet on high, quickly roast your spices plus the cinnamon stick and star anise. Roast for a few minutes, continously stirring, until you start smelling the aroma."
- "Step 6            Put the spices in the satchel it comes with and put it in the stock."
- "Step 7            Once the broth has come to a boil, turn it down to a simmer and cover. Let it simmer for 5 - 6 hours. It&#39;s edible after 1 hr but tastes the best after 6 hrs."
- "Step 8            While the broth is simmering, you can prepare your toppings. Thinly slice the onions, finely chop the cilantro and green onions. Wash the bean sprouts, slice the lime. Soak your pho noodles in warm water. Wash and slice jalapenos. Wash basil."

- "Step 11            Season with salt, fish sauce, sugar, and boullion. I don&#39;t measure my ingredients so keep tasting and add to your liking. If you don&#39;t have rock sugar, you can use regular sugar. You don&#39;t have to get fish sauce if you cant find it but I find it makes a difference if you don&#39;t."
- "Step 12            To prepare your bowl of pho, in a separate small pot, fill it with water and bring to a boil. Cook your pho noodles per serving. Do not cook it all if you&#39;re not eating it right away or else it won&#39;t be good later. The noodles cook very quickly - just 1 - 2 min. Strain and put it in your bowl."
- "Step 13            Put your sliced beef on your hot noodles. You can use the presliced beef."
- "Step 14            Pour your hot broth over your beef and it will cook it."
- "Step 15            Put your toppings on and enjoy!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
