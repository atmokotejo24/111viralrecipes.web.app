recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Prepare the tomato sauce.  In a skillet over low heat, add Alce Nero&#39;s olive oil.  Add garlic and chili flakes.  Allow the garlic and chili flakes to simmer in the oil for about 15 mins.  *The heat has to be on super low, or the garlic will burn very fast.*"
- "Step 2            As soon as the garlic starts to brown, remove from heat and transfer into a large bowl.  Add in Alce Nero&#39;s tomato sauce.  Taste and adjust for seasonings with salt and pepper.  Mix to combine well. Mix, mix, mix.  Set aside until ready to use.  *The sauce can be kept in the fridge for up to 5 days.*"
- "Step 3            Prepare the chicken parmesan.  Butterfly the chicken breast and slice into halves.  Place the chicken breast on the working surface.  Wrap with cling film.  Using a meat mallet, pound the chicken to tenderize until almost the same thickness."
- "Step 4            Dredge the chicken with flour.  Shake off any excess.  In a shallow bowl, add egg, mustard and paprika.  Mix to combine well."
- "Step 5            Add in the chicken.  Coat the chicken well with the egg mixture.  Cover with cling film and set aside in the fridge for about 1 hr."
- "Step 6            In a shallow bowl, add cornflakes, panko, togarashi, nori, salt and pepper.  Combine everything together.  In a skillet over medium heat, add 1 inch of oil.  *To check the temperature of the oil, insert a wooden chopstick. If bubbles start to form around the chopstick, the temperature of the oil is ready for frying.*"
- "Step 7            Dredge the chicken onto the cornflakes mixture.  Press the cornflakes mixture onto the chicken.  *You can lay the chicken in between parchment paper. Lightly roll using a rolling pin. So that the cornflakes mixture will adhere to the chicken.*"
- "Step 8            Using a pair of tongs, gently drop the chicken into the oil away from you.  Pan fry until golden brown on both sides.  Remove from heat and drain off excess oil onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper."
- "Step 9            Top each chicken with mozzarella and parmigiano reggiano.  Wack into oven and bake until the cheese has melted.  Remove from oven and set aside."
- "Step 10            To plate.  *It is best to cook the pasta concurrently with the chicken. So that when the chicken is outta the oven, you can immediately plate and serve.*  Bring a pot of 3 liters of water to a boil."
- "Step 11            Season with sea salt until it tastes like the ocean.  Add in the Alce Nero&#39;s spaghetti.  Cook until al dente.  Transfer the pasta into the tomato sauce."
- "Step 12            Adjust the amount of tomato sauce to your preference.  Less is always more.  Add in parsley, basil and more parmigiano."
- "Step 13            Toss to combine well and until the pasta is fully coated with the sauce.  If the mixture gets too thick, add in 1 TBSP of pasta water at a time to loosen the sauce.  Twirl pasta onto serving plate."
- "Step 14            Garnish with more basil and parmigiano.  Dollop a spoonful of tomato sauce onto the plate.  Place the chicken parmesan onto the sauce.  Serve immediately."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
