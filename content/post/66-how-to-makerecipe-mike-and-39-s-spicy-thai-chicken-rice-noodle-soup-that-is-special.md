You&#39;ll definitely want a lot of broth for this dish.                                                                                                                         ● Turn off heat."

The noodles will cook almost immediately.                                              ● Allow soup with noodles to sit for 1 minute before garnishing and serving."

They always seem to have great fun doing that! See the Garnishment section for options.                                                                                                                                                                            ● IMHO opinion as a Chef - additional fresh thai basil leaves, the squeeze of a lime wedge, Siracha Garlic Chile and Soy Sauce are absolutely essential - garnishment wise - in this soup upon serving. Enjoy!"
