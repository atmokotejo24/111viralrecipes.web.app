recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Prepare your eggs. I find what works best is to place room temperature eggs in a pot with room temperature water. Place the pot on the stove with a lid sitting ajar. Switch on the burner or plate to a medium-low heat and set a timer for 12 minutes. This is if you are using large chicken eggs. Once they are ready set them aside until assembly time."
- "Step 2            Now prepare your broth. This will take the longest of all the elements but will require minimal attention. In a medium sized pot add all your ingredients and fill the pot with water. Place the pot on the stove and bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and let the broth cook for about an hour. Keep the pot lid on with a slight opening. This will prevent excessive evaporation of your broth."
- "Step 3            While your broth is simmering away to become a heart-warming meal you can salt your steak. Place you steak in a container that can be closed. Sprinkle sea salt and black pepper all over the steak on either side. Allow this to rest for the time the broth needs to finish cooking."
- "Step 4            After an hour, your broth should be ready. Remove the pot from the heat and strain out the broth in a heat-proof bowl."
- "Step 5            Heat a skillet or pan to a high heat. Add oil, a neutral oil. Once the oil is heated through then add in your steak. Cook either side for 2-4 minutes depending on how you enjoy your meat. Once you turn over to the second side add a knob of butter to the pan and use the melted butter to baste the steak. Kill the heat of the steak pan and place your steak on a wooden board. Allow to rest while you prepare the udon noodles and baby marrow."
- "Step 6            Fill a pot with water and salt the water well. Bring the water to a boil and then add your udon noodles. Allow to cook for about 5 minutes. Remove udon noodles from the heat and drain off the water."
- "Step 7            In another smaller pan, heat some butter. Add your baby marrow once the butter is melted. I would suggest cutting the baby marrow into strips but you are welcome to whatever shape you prefer. Cook them until they are slightly golden on the outside."
- "Step 8            Time for plating. Take your bowl and add a few drops of sesame oil to the bottom of the bowl. Place a portion of udon noodles in the middles of the bowl. Fill the bowl two-thirds of the way with broth. Slice the egg in half and slice the ostrich steak into strips. Now you can place the rest of the elements on top of the noodles in whatever pattern you would like. Sprinkle with some chilli powder or spring onion and serve."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
