recipeingredient:
- "1 pound chicken wings cut into 3s First and second sections preferred Use the 3rd for stock I love the 3rd fried but dont know how they work in this recipe"
- " No oil needed wings are fatty enough"
- " Salt Be sure your salt doesnt have an additive that makes it pour when it rains because it might make us sensitive people cough"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            If you&#39;re using Costco party wings, cut off the top; remove the icky paper.  If not using this product, add wings to a secure baggie.  It&#39;s not a good idea to wash them."
- "Step 2            Holding/closing the top, add some salt (see above about salt additives). Shake to cover wing parts."
- "Step 3            Place &#34;The Ultimate Best Parchment Paper Especially Designed for Air Fryers&#34; in the air fryer. It&#39;s cut to fit and has holes in it. I got it at Amazon. I don&#39;t use a rack, just the parchment. It works and there is no rack to clean. But please use the rack if you&#39;d prefer. Let us know if it&#39;s even better. I hate cleaning racks."
- "Step 4            Preheat the fryer at 400 degrees for about seven minutes. When hot, place the wings -- in one layer -- on the parchment paper, make sure they cover the whole paper, especially the edges. Otherwise, the paper will fly all over the fryer, burn a little and scare you -- as it did me. I also make them without the paper. Just as good. More cleaning."
- "Step 5            Use the air fryer&#39;s instructions to set time and temperature -- or not. I use 400 degrees F (my air fryer said 360F) and 25 minutes."
- "Step 6            At 12-13 minutes left to cook, my air fryer dings for me to turn the wings. So far, I just give them a little toss: no need to turn each one."
- "Step 7            When the browning is to your liking, remove and drain on paper towels or however you drain fried things."
- "Step 8            I often cook two batches of wings, plus potatoes and fish filets at the same time as the wings. You decide which comes first. Fish last, for me. I like the (very light) chicken flavor on potatoes."
- "Step 9            When cooled, place the inside, washable parts of the air fryer in sink, add soap and warm/hot water. Soak. Brush. Check and dry throughly before returning to fryer."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
