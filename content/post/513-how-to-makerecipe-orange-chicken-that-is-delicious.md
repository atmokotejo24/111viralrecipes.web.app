recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Melt the butter with the olive oil, add the garlic and the onion, wait a minute to add the green pepper, the parsley and the cilantro. Once all of our ingredients are lightly fried we add the chicken (marinate the chicken previously), wait for the chicken to seal from both sides,  don&#39;t forget to turn the chicken eventually for an even cook."
- "Step 2            Once you have your chicken perfectly sealed add the orange juice, for the orange juice I prefer to squeeze my oranges, it gives a more natural taste. Add a quick dash of white wine, sugar, salt, pepper, onion salt, and garlic powder. It&#39;s very important to be tasting your sauce while adding these ingredients, that way you can give your own touch to the flavor."
- "Step 3            Cover your pot with the lid and wait until the sauce boils at a medium temperature. Open your pot and wait for the sauce to reduce. Once you have a nice texture its ready to eat, you can serve it with some smashed potatoes and a green salad."
