The chicken can be seasoned with any of your favorite seasonings but I like using Italian seasoning and a dash of garlic powder. Season the chicken with ¾ teaspoon. Use a pair of tongs to toss the noodles, helping them separate. As you toss a creamy sauce will form as any liquid left in the pan will mix with the cream and the Parmesan as it melts. Serve the pasta immediately in its sauce.
