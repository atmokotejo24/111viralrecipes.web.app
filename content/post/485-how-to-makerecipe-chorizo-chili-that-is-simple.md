recipeingredient:
- "1.5 Tablespoons oil"
- "2 medium yellow onions peeled and chopped into a 14inch dice"
- "4 jalapeos minced"
- "10 cloves garlic chopped"
- "2 pounds 8020 ground beef"
- "10-12 ounces Mexican chorizo pork or beef the kind you have to cook as opposed to the Spanish cold cut type"
- "15 ounce can of tomatoes"
- "2 Tablespoons tomato paste"
- "2 teaspoons cayenne or more to taste"
- "2 teaspoons cumin theres already quite a bit of cumin in the chorizo"
- "2 teaspoons chili powder"
- "1 Tablespoon Tapato or other Mexicantype hot sauce w notable acid element like Valencia or Cholula Tabasco works in a pinch"
- "2 cups unsalted stock chicken or beef"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt to start"
- "1-2 (15 ounces) cans of beans of your choice drained I prefer garbanzos"
recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            In a preheated medium pot (at least 4 quarts), sweat the onions, peppers, and garlic in the oil until the onions are translucent. (Probably 4 or 5 minutes.)"
- "Step 2            Turn the heat up to medium high and dump in the ground beef, chorizo, canned tomatoes, tomato paste, spices, hot sauce, and stock, using a spoon or spatula to break up the beef and chorizo, and give everything a few gentle stirs to distribute all the ingredients evenly."
- "Step 3            When the chili comes to a gentle boil (say, a bubble per second or so), turn the heat down to medium low and simmer, lid askew (with a 1/2-inch opening on one side), for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally."
- "Step 4            Add the beans and kosher salt and stir them in to distribute evenly. Gently simmer again (gently meaning that there&#39;s barely detectible movement under the surface), lid askew, for another 40 minutes, stirring and scraping the bottom every 10 minutes or so. Scraping the bottom is a good way to monitor if the heat is too high for slow cooking. If you can scrape stuff off the bottom of the pot while doing a long simmer, your heat&#39;s too high, and you should adjust down accordingly."
- "Step 5            After 40 minutes, check the seasoning of your chili, and if you want to add more salt or spices, add them now, stir thoroughly a few times, and let it simmer again, partially covered for another 10 to 15 minutes. If not, it&#39;s ready to eat."
- "Step 6            Enjoy! :)"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
