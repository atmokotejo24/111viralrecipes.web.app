recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Prepare the yakitori chicken base. If you are using storebought  negima (chicken and leek skewers) skip ahead to Step 6. Otherwise, cut the chicken into about 3 cm cubes."
- "Step 2            Cut the Japanese leek into 3 cm pieces to match the amount of chicken pieces you prepared in Step 1."
- "Step 3            Skewer the chicken and leek pieces alternately. This may be hard to do if you&#39;re not used to doing it. If so, go on and read Steps 4 and 5."
- "Step 4            【How to skewer the chicken cleanly and easily】Arrange the chicken cubes from step 1 in one layer on a piece of cling film and it up. Put in the freezer for 40 minutes to 1 hour until partially frozen."

- "Step 12            The chicken skewers are delicious enough right after Step 9 is complete, but I like to quickly toast the skewers over a flame just before serving. If you don&#39;t have a gas burner you can wram them up over a grill or in a toaster oven."
- "Step 13            Transfer to serving plates and it&#39;s done. People are always paying visits to our house all year round, and this is one of the most popular dishes that we serve."
