recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Mix miso paste with warm water until completely dissolved. Add the orange juice, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar. Mix well."
- "Step 2            Heat the sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper. Saut√© until fragrant. Be careful! It&#39;ll brown quickly!"
- "Step 3            Add the orange juice &amp; miso mixture to the saucepan. Mix well and bring to a simmer."
- "Step 4            While bringing sauce to a simmer, mix together 1 tbsp cornstarch with 3 tbsp cool water to form a thin mixture. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce. Simmer until thickened. Cover and set sauce to the side."

- "Step 6            Heat oil in a dutch oven or large frying pan. Test the hot oil by dropping in a small piece of the seitan. Once the ideal temperature is reached, fry in batches. The size of your batches will depend on the size of your frying pan (I do two using my large dutch oven). Fry until golden brown; 1-2 minutes per side. Place fried seitan on paper towels to drain excess oil."
