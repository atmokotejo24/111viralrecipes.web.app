The spiciest curry you are likely to find on most menus is the phaal or Naga Curry. This curry has a deep red colour and is packed with different types of chilli. The vindaloo is also scorching hot. Jalfrezi done properly i.e. fresh chillis is usually hotter in my experience. In my experience with the BIR curries, the madras is pretty much just a milder vindaloo.
