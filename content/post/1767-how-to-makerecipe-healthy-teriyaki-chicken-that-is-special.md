recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            FOR THE CHICKEN: Pat dry chicken with paper towel. Place the chicken thighs/ or chicken breasts into a gallon size zip lock bag. Set aside."
- "Step 2            MARINADE: Mix together coconut aminos, minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and freshly ground four peppercorns. Pour the marinade over the chicken. Secure the zip lock bag and give a chicken gentle massage to coat it in the marinade. Let it marinade in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or up to a day, best if overnight. Once the chicken has marinated, remove it from the marinade, and drain over the strainer."
- "Step 3            TERIYAKI SAUCE: Meanwhile, whisk together: coconut aminos, oyster sauce, honey, chili garlic sauce, and plenty of black pepper."
- "Step 4            SLURRY: Mix 1 tablespoon of coconut amino with ¼ teaspoon arrowroot until dissolved, pour it into a sauce, whisk and set aside. (Careful with arrowroot, it gets much thicker than any other thickening agents. ¼ teaspoon is a good amount for this sauce volume)."
- "Step 5            COOKING CHICKEN: Heat ½ tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken pieces (you can cook chicken pieces in batches) until well browned on each side and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side. (Don’t overcook, you want the chicken to be slightly undercooked) Remove the chicken to a deep baking dish lined with aluminum foil, cover tightly, and keep warm (it will help the chicken to rest and continue to cook)."
- "Step 6            Once all the chicken has been removed from the skillet, in the same skillet add the remaining ½ tablespoon of oil and minced garlic. Sauté for 1 minute. (Don’t let the garlic burn) Pour the sauce into the skillet. Bring the sauce to a boil and reduce it to a simmer, cooking the sauce until it thickens, about 3 minutes. Stirring occasionally."
- "Step 7            Meanwhile; slice the cooked chicken (this step is optional). Keep the heat low. Add the cooked chicken back to the skillet, coat it in the sauce, and the chicken warms through. Turn the heat off. Garnish with sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds if desired. Serve with rice."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
