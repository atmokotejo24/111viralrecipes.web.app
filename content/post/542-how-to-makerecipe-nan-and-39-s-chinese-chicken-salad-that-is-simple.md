recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1            Mix a batch of my Asian Marinade &amp; Stir-Fry Sauce. Place chicken breast in a large ziplock bag. Add Asian Marinade to cover. Refrigerate and allow to marinate 3 hours or overnight. Grill the marinated chicken, basting with the marinade, until done. Set aside to cool for 30 minutes, then refrigerate. Slice when completely chilled.                                                                       Asian Marinade &amp; Stir-Fry Sauce"
- "Step 2            Remove the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles. Break up the noodles. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low to medium heat. Stir in the noodles to coat with butter. Sprinkle on the seasoning packet and sesame seeds. Fry, stirring, until toasted. Remove from skillet and set aside. (I doubled the recipe here.)"
- "Step 3            Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan. Blanch the snow peas by stirring into the boiling water and immediately removing/draining and plunging/stirring them into a large bowl of ice water. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Cut longer snow peas in half."
- "Step 4            If using bok choy, cut the white stem from the leafy greens. Some of the white bok choy stem can be sliced very thin to add to your salad greens mix. Slice baby peppers if using."
- "Step 5            Place salad greens in a large salad bowl along with the chicken, snow peas, green onions, sweet pepper rings, and mandarin oranges. Toss with my Toasted Sesame Dressing, if planning to serve it all, or let diners dress their own. Sprinkle on the fried ramen, toss well, and serve immediately."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
