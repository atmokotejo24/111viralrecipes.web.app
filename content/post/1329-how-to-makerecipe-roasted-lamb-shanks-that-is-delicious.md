Excellent served with polenta or roasted garlic mashed potatoes, my family&#39;s favorite, to soak up the wonderful sauce. Use a classic butcher knife, something good like Wusthof, to trim as much of the outer fat from the shank as you can, set the fat aside, and then rub the shank with the lemon juice. Insert a clove of gresh garlic into each slit you cut. Heat oil in a medium Dutch oven over high heat until smoking.
